            <p>Well I am a really clumsy person. Some years ago, I managed to let a knife fell on the foot of my husband
                (by
                accident, I swear ðŸ˜¬) That was hopefully not a so serious injury but still, we had to go to the
                emergency.
                The
                doctor and nurses were really laughing at us. We are still married today so I suppose he is not too much
                resentful about that...</p>
            <h3>TL;DR</h3>
            <p>Just don't let me go near a knife ...</p>
